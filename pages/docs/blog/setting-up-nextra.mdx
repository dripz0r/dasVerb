# Setting Up Nextra Documentation

*Published: March 9, 2024*

Today, we're excited to announce the launch of our new documentation system using Nextra! This marks a significant step in making DasVerb more accessible to developers and contributors.

## Why Nextra?

We chose Nextra for several reasons:

1. **Built on Next.js**: Seamless integration with our existing stack
2. **MDX Support**: Write documentation with React components
3. **Beautiful Default Theme**: Clean, modern design out of the box
4. **Search Functionality**: Built-in search for easy navigation
5. **TypeScript Support**: Perfect for our TypeScript-based project

## Implementation Process

The setup was straightforward:

1. Installed Nextra and its docs theme:
   ```bash
   npm install nextra nextra-theme-docs
   ```

2. Updated `next.config.ts` to use Nextra:
   ```typescript
   import withNextra from 'nextra'
   
   export default withNextra({
     theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
     themeConfig: './theme.config.tsx',
   })(config)
   ```

3. Created our documentation structure:
   - `/docs/index.mdx` - Main documentation page
   - `/docs/project-structure.mdx` - Project organization
   - `/docs/changelog.mdx` - Version history
   - `/docs/blog/` - Development blog

## What's Next?

We're planning to:

1. Add more detailed API documentation
2. Create interactive examples
3. Add a contribution guide
4. Implement versioned documentation

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was integrating Nextra with our existing Next.js setup. We solved this by:

1. Carefully configuring the Next.js config
2. Ensuring proper TypeScript support
3. Setting up the correct file structure

## Conclusion

The new documentation system will make it easier for:

- New developers to get started
- Contributors to understand the project
- Users to find answers to their questions

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve our documentation!
