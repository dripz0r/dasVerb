## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** v18.x or later recommended. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** or **yarn:** Comes with Node.js or can be installed separately.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dripz0r/dasVerb.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd dasVerb
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project uses Genkit for its AI features, which connects to Google's Gemini models. You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
2.  **Add your Google AI Studio API key** to the `.env` file:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

    *Note: As Firebase integration progresses, additional environment variables for Firebase project configuration might be needed here.*

### Running the Application

You'll need to run two separate development servers: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Next.js Development Server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the web application, typically available at `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit Development Server:**
    Open a *new, separate* terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    (For automatic reloading on Genkit flow changes, you can use `npm run genkit:watch`)
    This starts the Genkit developer UI, usually available at `http://localhost:4000`. Here you can inspect, test, and trace your AI flows.
