# Project Structure

_Updated June 2024: This reflects the latest refactor, universal margins, dark mode polish, and AI integration fixes._

> **Note:** You may see duplicate folders (e.g., `dashboard` and `dashboard 2`) in the `app/` directory. These are a known issue—ignore the `2` folders for now. All real routes and features are in the non-`2` folders.

## Key Updates (2024)
- **Universal Margins & Containers:** All pages now use a consistent container for perfect margins and layout.
- **Dark Mode Polish:** Docs, dashboard, and all main pages have improved dark mode readability and style.
- **AI API Integration:** Gemini API key and routes fixed; all AI tools now work reliably.
- **Docs & Dashboard Consistency:** Visual polish and card-like layouts across all main sections.
- **Duplicate Folders:** Ignore any `2` folders in `app/`—these are a known artifact and not used.
- **Improved Comments:** All key files now have up-to-date comments and logic explanations.

## `/app/` Folder Breakdown
- **dashboard/**, **lessons/**, **flashcards/**, **ai-helper/**, **grammar-fixer/**, **story-generator/**: Main feature pages and tools.
- **docs/**: All documentation, including this page.
- **api/**: API routes for AI and backend logic.
- **layout.tsx**: Global layout (header, footer, container, Toaster).
- **globals.css**: Tailwind and custom CSS.
- **page.tsx**: Main landing page.

## `/src/` Folder Breakdown
- **components/**: All React components (UI, layout, feature forms, etc.)
- **ai/**: Genkit flows and Gemini integration
- **lib/**: Shared utilities
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks
- **types/**: TypeScript types (if present)

## Best Practices
- Add new features in `/app/` and `/src/components/`.
- Keep AI/backend logic in `/src/ai/` and `/app/api/`.
- Use universal containers for all main pages.
- Use Tailwind for styling; dark mode is handled globally.
- Update comments and docs as you go.
- See the [Changelog](/docs/changelog) for recent updates.
