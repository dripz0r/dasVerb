# Using Docs

Welcome to the DasVerb documentation! Here's how to get the most out of these docs:

## Navigation
- Use the sidebar to jump between sections.
- Each page covers a specific topic (features, project structure, dev notes, etc).

## Search
- Use your browser's search (Cmd+F or Ctrl+F) to find keywords.
- More advanced search coming soon!

## Contributing to Docs
- Found a typo or want to add something? Open a PR!
- Docs are in `/app/docs/(docs)/` as MDX files.

## Tips

- For project structure, see [Project Structure](/docs/project-structure).
