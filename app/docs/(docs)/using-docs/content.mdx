# Using Docs

Welcome to the DasVerb documentation! Here's how to get the most out of these docs:

## Navigation
- Use the sidebar to jump between sections.
- Each page covers a specific topic (features, project structure, dev notes, etc).
- Check out the [Resources](/docs/resources) page for tools, libraries, and future plans.

## Search
- Use your browser's search (Cmd+F or Ctrl+F) to find keywords.
- More advanced search coming soon!

## Contributing to Docs
- Found a typo or want to add something? Open a PR!
- Docs are in `/app/docs/(docs)/` as MDX files.

## How Docs Are Coded and Laid Out
- All docs are written in MDX, allowing you to use React components and Markdown.
- The docs are organized in `/app/docs/(docs)/` with a clear folder structure:
  - `using-docs/`: How to use the docs.
  - `features/`: Overview of all features.
  - `getting-started/`: Setup and installation guide.
  - `project-structure/`: Detailed project layout.
  - `dev-notes/`: Tips and gotchas for developers.
  - `changelog/`: Recent updates and changes.
  - `resources/`: Key tools, libraries, and future plans.
  - `blog/`: Development blog posts.
- Each page is a standalone MDX file, making it easy to add or modify content.
- Use the sidebar for navigation and the search for quick access.

## Tips
- Check the [Changelog](/docs/changelog) for recent updates.
- See [Dev Notes](/docs/dev-notes) for logic explanations and gotchas.
- For project structure, see [Project Structure](/docs/project-structure).
